11/19/2024 - Setup GitHub and file structure. Began work on challenge. 

-Used class examples for reference and Xpert for troubleshooting when stuck. 

-Line 13 from the queries.sql file was derived by asking multiple questions to Xpert on how to extract the year value from the date. I was initially using WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 1986 instead of the needed syntax for postgreSQL of: WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) = 1986

-Rebuilt DB and each table with revised primary keys
